**Description**:  
FractalVisualizer is a Python-based project focused on creating and visualizing fractal patterns through graphical representations. This project explores the mathematical beauty of fractals, using Python to generate complex, self-similar images that demonstrate the recursive nature of fractal geometry. 

**Features**:
- Generates fractal images such as the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and other customizable fractals.
- Provides options for zooming and color customization to highlight intricate details.
- Uses libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy to render high-quality, interactive fractal graphics.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Python**: Core programming language used for mathematical computations and fractal generation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing the fractal patterns.
- **NumPy**: For efficient mathematical operations on arrays, enabling faster rendering of fractals. 

**Usage**:
Run the scripts to generate different fractal patterns and experiment with parameters to explore a wide variety of fractal designs.
